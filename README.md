# ydata_profiling_customer_churn

Personal project to use ydata_profiling package.  I got the same key insight from the same dataset with less time and effort. 
<li>Key Insight from this EDA:  Customer "Exited" had highest correlation with "Complain"</li> See jpg file for screenshot
<li>Key Insight from yt channel: Same

Benefit:  This frees up time for the company and for analysts, and time savings can be allocated to deeper analysis in the future.  <br>
Advantage vs. yt method:  Creating EDA histograms and correlations from libraries, one by one, will involve more time and effort. <br>
yt channel used Tableau, which requires subscription.  <br>

Data source:  Data are from customer churn data shared by Data With Mo in youtube.
