# explainer_dashboard_customer

Personal project to use ydata_profiling package using ProfileReport module to explore customer churn data shared by Data With Mo in youtube. Results in significantly less time creating charts and histograms and frees up time for exploring deeper analysis in the future.  The channel used Tableau to gain his key insight of bad ratings leading to lost customers.  This code produced the same insight in just a few minutes, with an interactive html output.
