# ydata_profiling_customer_churn

Personal project to use ydata_profiling package to get insights from customer churn data shared by Data With Mo in youtube. Use of the package yields time savings vs. creating charts and histograms using other libraries and frees up time for exploring deeper analysis in the future.  The Data With Mo yt channel used Tableau to gain his key insight of bad ratings leading to lost customers.  This code produced the same insight in just a few minutes, with an interactive html output.
