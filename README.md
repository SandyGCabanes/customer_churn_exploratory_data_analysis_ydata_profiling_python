# ydata_profiling_customer_churn

Portfolio project to use ydata_profiling package.  I got the same key insight from the same dataset with less time and effort. <br>
**Key Insight from this EDA:**  Customer "Exited" had highest correlation with "Complain"

**Key Insight from yt channel:** Same as the Tableau insight used in Mo Chen's YouTube channel.

**Benefit:**  Using this package frees up time for the company and for analysts, and time savings can be allocated to deeper analysis in the future.  <br>

**Advantage vs. yt method (Tableau):**  Creating EDA histograms and correlations from libraries, one by one, will involve more time and effort. Tableau is more impressive as a talking point when communicating this main idea to stakeholders and has more interactive features that will allow stakeholders to slice the data further. <br>

**Data source:**  Data are from customer churn data shared by Data With Mo in youtube. [csv file](https://github.com/SandyGCabanes/customer_churn_exploratory_data_analysis_ydata_profiling_python/blob/main/Customer_Churn_Records.csv)<br>
